                    <strong>Coding</strong>
                    "What has really been the main drive of my college career, it started in high school with AP
                    Computer Science and just went from there.  Since then I have enjoyed the college classes and
                    hard projects that come with it.  The code.org lessons that have helped me grow in JavaScript
                    or C# when I really needed it for some courses, those are what I love.  The explanations and
                    the long development that comes with front-end developing is something that I kinda live for.
                    Honestly, to me, there is nothing better than not getting something in code and it being wrong
                    to finally getting it after hours of debugging and crying."

                    <strong>Exercise</strong>
                    "Something that has taken a very big role in my life is exercising, specifically lifting weights.
                    Always is fun to hit a lift after a hard day at work or right when you wake up, it is fun to get
                    the body moving in any way at all.  I was trying to get into running a bit more last year (which
                    was a big influence in my coding project last year) and still do partake, but the weights is
                    something that I always look to do three to four times a week."

                    <strong>Hockey</strong>
                    "Something that has been involved with my life since I was roughly three years old, hockey
                    was something that was bascially everything I had.  I played on the ACHA D3 team for OU and
                    it was some of the best times I ever had.  I still keep up with it and watch all I can.  I have
                    getting on the ice because it still keeps me in that kid-like mindset."
